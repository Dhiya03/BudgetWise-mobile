## Gemini Code Assist - Implementation Plan

My goal is to build a system that delivers daily, localized financial tips to users via push notifications to increase engagement and financial literacy. The implementation will be phased, starting with the core MVP features.

---

#### **Phase 1: Core MVP Implementation**

This phase focuses on delivering the fundamental value of the feature: getting a daily, localized tip.

**1. Epic: Tip Content & Delivery Service**
*   **Goal:** Create the backbone for managing and scheduling the tips.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   **Data Structure:** Implement the `FinancialTip` interface in `src/types.ts` to hold the tip's ID, category (`funny`, `fact`, `advice`, `myth-buster`), difficulty, emoji, and translations.
    *   **Content Store:** Create a JSON file (e.g., `src/data/financial-tips.json`) to house the initial set of 50+ tips, ensuring each has an entry for English, Hindi, Tamil, and Telugu.
    *   **Service Layer (`FinancialTipsService.ts`):**
        *   Create a service class to encapsulate all tip-related logic.
        *   Implement a `getTodaysTip()` method that randomly selects a tip for the day, ensuring it doesn't repeat until all have been shown.
        *   This service will handle fetching the correct translation based on the user's language preference.

**2. Epic: Notification Scheduling & Permissions**
*   **Goal:** Ensure a tip is reliably delivered to the user's device every day.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   **Integration:** Use the `@capacitor/local-notifications` plugin.
    *   **Permissions:** On app startup (in `App.tsx`), check for notification permissions. If not granted, prompt the user to enable them.
    *   **Daily Scheduling:**
        *   Create a function that schedules a daily notification for 10:00 AM local time.
        *   The notification's title and body will be pulled from the `FinancialTipsService` based on the user's selected language.
        *   This scheduling logic should be robust, re-scheduling itself for the next day after it fires. It should also re-schedule on app open to ensure consistency.
    *   **Native Configuration:** Update `AndroidManifest.xml` to handle Android's battery optimization and ensure timely delivery (using `SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM`).

**3. Epic: User-Facing UI & Interaction**
*   **Goal:** Allow users to see, interact with, and manage the tips.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   **Tip Display Component:** Create a reusable React component (`TipCard.tsx`) that takes a `FinancialTip` object and the current language as props and displays it in a card format with its emoji and category.
     *   **Language Setting:** In the `SettingsTab` component, add a language selection dropdown (visible only to Plus/Premium users, as per `LOCALIZATION_PLAN.md`) that allows the user to choose between English, Hindi, Tamil, and Telugu. This choice will be saved to `localStorage` and used by the `FinancialTipsService`.
    *   **Sharing:** The `TipCard` component will include a "Share" button that uses the Capacitor Share API to open the native share sheet, pre-filled with the `shareText` from the tip data.

---

#### **Phase 2: Enhancements & Personalization (Future Sprints)**

These features build upon the MVP to make the system smarter and more user-centric.

**1. Epic: User Customization & Control**
*   **Goal:** Give users more control over how they receive tips.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   In the `SettingsTab`, add a control to select a custom notification time (defaulting to 10:00 AM).
    *   Add a toggle switch to disable/enable tip notifications entirely.
    *   The notification scheduling logic will need to be updated to respect these new settings.

**2. Epic: Contextual & Tier-Based Tips**
*   **Goal:** Make the tips more relevant to the user's in-app behavior and subscription level.
*   **Tasks:**
    *   **In-App Widget:** Create a floating `InAppTipWidget` component that appears occasionally (e.g., after adding an expense in a high-spend category).
    *   **Contextual Logic:** The `FinancialTipsService` will be enhanced to select tips based on contextual triggers (e.g., if a user is looking at the 'Investment' section, show an investment-related tip).
    *   **Subscription Awareness:** The service will filter tips based on the user's subscription tier, allowing for exclusive "Premium" advice.
