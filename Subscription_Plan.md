## Option 1: Gemini

### A Strategic Subscription Model for BudgetWise

The model is designed around a core principle: **Earn trust, then demonstrate value.**

*   **Free Tier (BudgetWise Lite):** The best basic budget tracker a user has ever used. It's fast, reliable, and helps them solve their immediate problem: "Where is my money going?".
*   **One-Time Pass (BudgetWise Plus):** A low-friction bridge to premium. It introduces users to goal-oriented planning, moving beyond simple tracking.
*   **Subscription (BudgetWise Premium):** The ultimate toolkit for financial optimization. It's for users who are ready to automate, analyze, and secure their financial life.

### Tier 1: BudgetWise Lite (Free)

**Objective:** Earn the user's trust and showcase the app's quality and potential. This tier should be fully functional for basic expense tracking and budgeting.

**Core Proposition:** "Master your daily spending, for free, forever."

**Features & Limitations:**
- **Transaction Management**: Unlimited add/edit/delete.
- **Monthly Budgeting**: Limited to 5 categories.
- **History Tab**: Full view and search. Filtering by tag is disabled.
- **Basic Dashboard**: View Monthly Balance and Spent cards.
- **Security**: Full access to PIN lock. This is a crucial trust-builder.
- **Data Export**: Quick CSV Export only.

**The Hook (Upsell Strategy):** Features are visible but locked. A gentle, non-intrusive "Premium" icon or tooltip next to a feature will pique curiosity. Clicking it brings up a screen explaining the value of upgrading.

- **Add Tab**: "Custom Budget" option is greyed out.
- **Navigation Bar**: "Analytics" and "Reminders" tabs are visible but lead to an upgrade screen.
- **Budget Tab**: Custom Budgets, Automation, and Fund Transfer sections are visible but disabled.
- **Settings Tab**: Advanced reports are disabled.

### Tier 2: BudgetWise Plus (One-time 3-Month Pass)

**Objective:** Act as a paid trial. Get users invested in features they won't want to lose, making the jump to a full subscription feel natural.

**Core Proposition:** "Achieve your short-term goals. A powerful upgrade for a single price."

**Features & Limitations:**
- All Free Features
- **Custom Budgets**: Unlocked, with a limit of 3 active budgets.
- **Bill Reminders**: Unlocked, with a limit of 5 active reminders.
- **Recurring Transactions**: Fully unlocked.
- **Tagging & Filtering**: Fully unlocked.
- **Limited Analytics**: Access to Financial Health Score, Cash Flow, and basic category breakdowns.

**The Hook (Upsell Strategy):** The 3-month pass is designed to expire. When it does, the user will have active budgets and reminders they've come to rely on. The value of maintaining them provides a powerful incentive to subscribe to Premium. In-app messages should highlight this: "Your Plus Pass has expired. Upgrade to Premium to keep managing your goals."
