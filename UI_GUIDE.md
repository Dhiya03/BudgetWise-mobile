## üõ†Ô∏è Developer Guide: Building for Android

This guide outlines the steps to wrap the BudgetWise web application into a native Android APK using Capacitor.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
-   **Node.js** (LTS version recommended)
-   **Android Studio** with the Android SDK

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

Navigate to your project's root directory in the terminal and install the necessary Capacitor dependencies.

```bash
npm install @capacitor/cli @capacitor/core --save-dev
npm install @capacitor/android --save-dev
```

### Step 2: Initialize Capacitor

If this is the first time setting up Capacitor for the project, run the `init` command.

```bash
npx cap init
```

You will be prompted for the following:
-   **App Name**: `BudgetWise`
-   **App ID**: `com.budgetwise.app` (a unique identifier for your app)

This creates a `capacitor.config.ts` file. Ensure the `webDir` is set to `'dist'`, which is Vite's default output directory.

```typescript
import type { CapacitorConfig } from '@capacitor/cli';

const config: CapacitorConfig = {
  appId: 'com.budgetwise.app',
  appName: 'BudgetWise',
  webDir: 'dist',
  server: {
    androidScheme: 'https'
  }
};

export default config;
```

### Step 3: Add the Android Platform

This command creates the native Android project in an `android/` directory at the root of your project.

```bash
npx cap add android
```

### Step 4: Build and Sync the Web App

Whenever you make changes to the web application code (in the `src` folder), you must create a production build and sync it with the native project.

1.  **Build the web assets:**
    ```bash
npm run build
    ```
2.  **Sync with Android:** This copies the web files from `dist/` into the native project.
    ```bash
npx cap sync
    ```

### Step 5: Build the APK in Android Studio

1.  **Open the project in Android Studio:**
    ```bash
npx cap open android
    ```
    Android Studio will launch and load the native project. The initial Gradle sync may take a few moments.

2.  **Build the APK:**
    -   From the Android Studio menu bar, select **Build > Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) > Build APK(s)**.
    -   Once the build is complete, a notification will appear with a link to the generated `app-debug.apk` file.
    -   You can install this APK on an Android emulator or a physical device for testing.

## üåê Developer Guide: Running as a Web App

The BudgetWise application can also be run as a standard web application locally for testing and development purposes. This leverages Vite's built-in development server.

### Steps to Run Locally

1.  **Navigate to the project directory** in your terminal.

2.  **Install dependencies** (if you haven't already):
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Start the development server**:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    After running this command, your terminal will display a local URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5173/`). Open this URL in your web browser to access the application. Changes to your code will automatically update in the browser due to Hot Module Replacement (HMR).
